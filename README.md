# Speech Emotion Recognition
This project explores the use of deep neural network architectures to recognize emotions from speech, using the RAVDESS dataset. The main focus is on comparing the performance of CNN, LSTM, and pre-trained VGG16 models, along with analyzing the effect of data augmentation techniques.
